# [Advanced Games Programming](http://richardsondaniel.co.uk/university/cgt-year-3/trimester-1/advanced-games-programming-advanced-projects/)

The Advanced Games Programming module taught advanced programming concepts in C++, graphics, networking and multi-threading. It was entirely assessed through practical coursework and gave students freedom to explore advanced topics that intrigued them. 
 
## Assignment

The assignment was in two parts. Part one was to implement an advanced topic and then create a lab as if you were teaching it to someone else. Part two was to take a much more advanced topic and implement it.

# [Algorithms &amp; Collections &nbsp; ](http://richardsondaniel.co.uk/university/cgt-year-3/trimester-1/algorithms-and-collections/)

The algorithms and collections module taught unsurprisingly algorithms and collections. It was assessed with both an exam and a coding assignment. All module tutorials and lectures were taught using Java and the Java Collection Framework. Even though the course until this point had only focused on C++ this gave students a new opportunity to better understand a new and popular language as well as learning fundamental concepts to computer science. 
 
## Assignment

The assignment was to take a basic binary tree implementation and extend it to be more efficient and useful. Then to compare it with the traditional binary tree found in the Java Collections Framework the `TreeSet`. Which is internally implemented as a binary search tree.

**Tasks**
* Implement Extended Binary Tree
* Insert elements at the root for better performance
* Compare with a Red Black Tree (`TreeSet`)
* Implement Serialization

# [Mobile Games Development](http://richardsondaniel.co.uk/university/cgt-year-3/trimester-2/mobile-games-development-eggdrop/)

The mobile games development module was a crash course in web technologies to those with a more traditional programming background. Students were expected to write a 2D or 3D game using a popular JavaScript framework to showcase their understanding of basic web technologies. While the game that had to be developed did not need to be overly complex students had to meet a set of goals for their submission to be considered valid. It was a fun module that I really enjoyed. 
 
## Assignment

The assignment was rather simple. First students had to write a design brief which set out their project but this design brief was to be short and to the point. Then students just needed to develop it using good development practices and make a playable version available online. However to be a valid submission the game made must have two or more of the below listed features.

<details><summary>FamilyTree.</summary>
<p>

# [FamilyTree](http://richardsondaniel.co.uk/university/cgt-year-2/trimester-1/structures-and-algorithms/)

The coursework was split into three sections the first section was to create the initial family tree class, it should be able to identify the current working family member partners to the family member children of the family member and siblings of selected family member, It should also a method to add a child to any member should they have a partner, this was accompanied by a tester class that would test these methods where functioning correctly.

For section two we where to expand upon our initial classes, we where to add an addPartner method to add a partner to any selected member should they be compatible, the display method should be updated to also display the entire family tree no just immediate family and finally a few extra smaller parameters.

Section three should add the ability using recursion for any person with in the tree at any point to have a child added to them should they also have a child instead of the family tree working down as it goes.

# [Game Engine Design](http://richardsondaniel.co.uk/university/cgt-year-2/trimester-1/game-engine-design-fantasy-rogue-game/)

The game engine design module aimed to teach students design patterns and common coding patterns found in game engines. It also taught students inheritance found in C++ and common C++ advanced topics such as the standard template library known as STL. 

## Assignment

The assignment was to develop a prototype game that showed off good use of modern C++ and design patterns. The goal was not to create an awesome game but merely show off the concepts taught in the module. Additionally a report was required to describe the design and what features have been implemented along with a general report.

# [LunarLander](http://richardsondaniel.co.uk/university/cgt-year-1/trimester-2/2d-graphics-programming-lunar-lander/)

This module would be our first real test of personal programming, we where given two tasks to choose from  the first was a cannon firing which would require proper gravity physics and the second was a Lunar lander simulation in which you would need to create a simulated landing on the moon with some included gravity physics. I chose the latter as I personally felt I would enjoy the task of simulating a low gravity landing, the task required that a random terrain be generated at the bottom of the screen with a section or two of flat terrain for landing and a Lander be spawned in a random location in the upper part of the screen the Lander would then have a limited amount of fuel in which to land safely.

## Assignment

The Lander must also have a “floaty” style to it, having a lower then earth style gravity always being pulled towards the surface of the moon. The lander’s fuel is limited as such to not make the game overly easy or overly hard it should give just enough fuel to make their decent or enough to set the lander on a correct trajectory towards a flat land. Should the lander pass throughout the left or right borders of the screen it will be transported to the opposite side of the screen, the top border is open as to let the lander have some extra height to play with, however going to high will also count as a death.

# [Real Time 3D](http://richardsondaniel.co.uk/university/cgt-year-2/trimester-2/real-time-3d-3d-game-creation/)

The real time 3D module taught basic 3D graphics using an industry standard graphics library and programming language. Students learn the theoretical underpinnings of 3D graphics - from elementary viewing to scene graphs, gain a basic understanding of contemporary graphics hardware. It is assessed with a practical coursework where students develop a 3D demo and show it both to fellow students and module lectures. 

## Assignment

Using C++ and OpenGL students were to produce a 3D tech demo in which a player can control an animated character around a 3D,lit, environment. The demo should then be presented to students and module lectures and a 3D recording made available should our project fail to build on university machines. Students could investigate advanced graphics topics and if implemented students would receive extra marks although a basic level would still yield a pass. Along with the practical aspect the following elements were mandatory for a basic pass (C Grade). 

* Software design document
* Software project report
* User instructions
* Reasonable  coding standard.
* Use object oriented code

# [Interactive Physical Modelling](http://richardsondaniel.co.uk/university/cgt-year-2/trimester-2/interactive-physical-modelling-racing-physics/)

The Interactive Physical Modelling module was about teaching basic physics to students which was assessed with an exam and a practical coursework. It was a chance for students to develop an understanding of how physics is simulated in both video games and wider computer software. While one of the more challenging modules it did provide a lot of opportunities to develop an interesting demo that proved students ability to take theoretical concepts and map them directly to software. 

## Assignment

The assignment was actually very simple. Make a physics demonstration in C++ with whatever technology you wanted. Providing you didn't use physics libraries as that would have been cheating. We were expected to work in teams with each members contribution made known through an individually submitted critical appraisal. The end playable demo should be the following.

* Replayable, with the option to vary parameters to show off effects
* Be written from scratch, no physics libraries allowed
* Show basic physics concepts such as gravity, velocity etc

The Computing Project was a module designed to allow students to work in teams to design a piece of software. The module assignment was actually just a design document and presentation. The module was more about developing professional skills rather than programming skills. When talking about professional skills I am of course talking about teamwork, communication, leadership and other professional qualities.

# [Teshi's Escape](http://richardsondaniel.co.uk/university/cgt-year-1/trimester-1/intro-to-games-development-teshis-escape/)

The following module was to create any game in which we wished this could be something original or an emulation of some past game you may have the played, the objective was to create this game and then make a very brief design document with some additional level onto of the one level you will developing then to pitch your game to a set of producers (lecturers) and create a mockup of your game with game cover, disc art and a poster to go along with it

# [Wheels3D](http://richardsondaniel.co.uk/university/cgt-year-3/trimester-2/games-technology-project-wheels-3d/)

In the 3rd year of university there was a key module, the Games Technology Project which was a double module which spanned two trimesters. The module was an opportunity for students to develop a game prototype in C++ and has always been used by students as a chance to develop a portfolio piece. 
 
## Assignment

The assignment was rather simple. In the first trimester students were to write a report setting out the design of the game from both a software and design perspective. Students were then to pitch their idea to a panel of experts who would offer advice on how to implement the game or ideas for improvement. In trimester two students were to implement the game as set out in their design document and a live demonstration was required to show off the game to the module markers.

# [Java Applications](http://richardsondaniel.co.uk/university/cgt-year-1/trimester-1/introduction-to-programming/)

For this module we were shown how to do some basic level Java programming, for the end of the semester we where required to have created a series of mini applications such as a interest calculator and a change input calculator, and one major application which was called “countdown” this application would have to read read in a series of words from the dictionary varying from five to 8 letters long, all of the consonants in the alphabet and finally all of the vowels within the alphabet. The application user will then have to input eight characters from a series of vowels and consonants these eight characters will then be compared to our already inputted dictionary of words and all the words that can be formed using these words will be displayed.
